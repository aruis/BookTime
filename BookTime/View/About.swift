           The ideaüí° for creating this app came from my daughterüëßüèª who is in the second grade of elementary school. She has an assignment that requires 30 minutes of reading every day. With this app, I can better urge her to read and clock in.
           The teacher counts the children's reading volume every semester and asks parents to make a record of their children's reading, so this app has helped me a lot, because her annual reading volume is about 100 books, it is really difficult for me to keep track of it. Record her reading progress. Now, I only need to export the reading data from the App.
           This App also helped me develop the habit of reading every day. You can find my [Reading Sharing Video](https://space.bilibili.com/24370353/channel/seriesdetail?sid=320833) here. You are also welcome to send [mail](mailto:cheetah_chugs.0g@icloud.com) to me to communicate anything you want to communicate.
           Finally, I hope you like this App, and I wish you always enjoy the fun of reading ‚ù§Ô∏è
