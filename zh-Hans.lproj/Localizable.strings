"       The idea💡 for creating this app came from my daughter👧🏻 who is in the second grade of elementary school. She has an assignment that requires 30 minutes of reading every day. With this app, I can better urge her to read and clock in.\n       The teacher counts the children's reading volume every semester and asks parents to make a record of their children's reading, so this app has helped me a lot, because her annual reading volume is about 100 books, it is really difficult for me to keep track of it. Record her reading progress. Now, I only need to export the reading data from the App.\n       This App also helped me develop the habit of reading every day. You can find my [Reading Sharing Video](https://space.bilibili.com/24370353/channel/seriesdetail?sid=320833) here. You are also welcome to send [mail](mailto:cheetah_chugs.0g@icloud.com) to me to communicate anything you want to communicate.\n       Finally, I hope you like this App, and I wish you always enjoy the fun of reading ❤️" = "          创作这个App的💡来源于我正在上小学二年级的👧🏻，她有项作业是每天要阅读30分钟，有了这个App，我就能更好地督促她读书打卡了。\n          老师每学期都要统计孩子的阅读量，要求家长做好孩子的阅读记录，所以这个App可帮了我大忙了，因为她每年的阅读量都在百本左右，我平时真的很难持续跟踪记录她的阅读进度。现在，我只要从App导出阅读数据就可以了。\n          这款App也帮我养成每天坚持阅读的习惯，您可以在这里找到我的[读书分享视频](https://space.bilibili.com/24370353/channel/seriesdetail?sid=320833)。也欢迎您发[邮件](mailto:cheetah_chugs.0g@icloud.com)给我，交流任何你想交流的事情。\n          最后，希望您喜欢这款App，也祝您永远享受阅读的乐趣❤️";
